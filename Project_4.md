## Multiple Boosting and Light GBM
### Part One: Implement multiple boosting algortihm and apply it to combinations of different regressors 
In this exercise, the "Concrete Compressive Strength" dataset was used. The imputs of this multiple boosting algorithm were 'concrete','water', and 'age'. These regressors were boosted a couple of times using the "Concrete Compressive Strength" dataset. The combination that achieved the best cross-validated results is shown below. 

### Part Two: The LightGBM algorithm 
Here the LightGBM method was applied to the same data set used for part 1.
