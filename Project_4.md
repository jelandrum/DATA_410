## Multiple Boosting and Light GBM
### Part One: Implement multiple boosting algortihm and apply it to combinations of different regressors 
In this exercise, regressor 1 was boosted with regressor 2 a couple of times using the "Concrete Compressive Strength" dataset. The combination that achieved the best cross-validated results is shown below. 

### Part Two: The LightGBM algorithm 
Here the LightGBM method was applied to the same data set used for part 1.
