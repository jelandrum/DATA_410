## Project 5: Comparison of Different Regularization and Variable Selection Techniques

In this project, different regularization techniques including Ridge, LASSO, Elastic Net, SCAD, and Square Root Lasso will be applied for comparison.

1. Sklearn compliant functions for Square Root Lasso and SCAD, used in conjunction with GridSearchCV for finding optimal hyper-parameters when data such as x-bar; and y-bar; are given.
